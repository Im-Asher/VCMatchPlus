* Fixes #5220 Send Trusted Direct Message

Implemented the ability to send messages w/o attachments via the EMR
Direct service over the Direct protocol.

Built the ability to select a document that has been uploaded to the
system and send it via EMRDirect.

Built a document finder dialog window so that you can select a patient
or non-patient document using the finder.  It checks against the current
user's ACLs and the document category's acos to determine if the user
can see the document.  It only shows 25 results at a time and requires
the user to be more specific in their search if they want to see more.
By default it displays the most recent documents uploaded.

* Direct pdf attachment send.

Made it so we can send a pdf attachment via direct.

Validated the mime types and reject any document that can't be sent via
Direct.  Interestingly direct supports sending HTML but our default
OpenEMR whitelist doesn't allow it.

* Fix styles

* Fix case where document is empty.

Changing up the ACL validation broke the functionality for sending a
single message w/o an attached document.

* Hide alerts before each message send.

If the same message error comes back for each message send it appears
like the direct message never sent.  Hiding the alerts each time when
the send button is pushed is a better UX experience.

* Implemented Document File Preview for messages.

Messages was throwing a javascript error if you didn't assign a patient
for a document.  However, often the document is what contains the
information about what patient the file should belong to.  I made it so
that if there is no assigned patient you can at least view the document
in the Miscellaneous -> New Documents screen.

This also facilitates testing with ONC as we have to demonstrate that
the Direct file was successfully decrypted and viewable.

* Fixes #5220 Send Trusted Direct Message

Implemented the ability to send messages w/o attachments via the EMR
Direct service over the Direct protocol.

Built the ability to select a document that has been uploaded to the
system and send it via EMRDirect.

Built a document finder dialog window so that you can select a patient
or non-patient document using the finder.  It checks against the current
user's ACLs and the document category's acos to determine if the user
can see the document.  It only shows 25 results at a time and requires
the user to be more specific in their search if they want to see more.
By default it displays the most recent documents uploaded.

* Direct pdf attachment send.

Made it so we can send a pdf attachment via direct.

Validated the mime types and reject any document that can't be sent via
Direct.  Interestingly direct supports sending HTML but our default
OpenEMR whitelist doesn't allow it.

* Fix styles

* Fix case where document is empty.

Changing up the ACL validation broke the functionality for sending a
single message w/o an attached document.

* Hide alerts before each message send.

If the same message error comes back for each message send it appears
like the direct message never sent.  Hiding the alerts each time when
the send button is pushed is a better UX experience.

* Implemented Document File Preview for messages.

Messages was throwing a javascript error if you didn't assign a patient
for a document.  However, often the document is what contains the
information about what patient the file should belong to.  I made it so
that if there is no assigned patient you can at least view the document
in the Miscellaneous -> New Documents screen.

This also facilitates testing with ONC as we have to demonstrate that
the Direct file was successfully decrypted and viewable.

* Fix code review issues.",Stored XSS Leads To Session Hijacking in GitHub repository openemr/openemr prior to 6.1.0.1.,0cf4ce14e9fec4908f5da7b7a4470badc7e7d9c0,0

can easily expand / add additional report item types such as the group
calculation method.

* Fix CQM formatting and data display problems.

Fix the old CQM reports for formatting and data display problems.  We
want to make sure we don't break the old reports.

* Fix CDR result links,formatting

* Refactored CDR Twig to be more DRY

* CDR provider,plans result report fixes

* Group Calculation Initial Support

Initial support for group calculation method

* More work on group calculation

* Group Calculation Encounter Relationship

Implemented the group calculation encounter relationship.  The primary
relationship is stubbed out but has some bugs I'll need to work on
fixing.

Also moved the patient report item tracker into a class relationship
that could eventually be used to streamline bulk inserts on the report
items.

Added some basic documentation and broke the group calculation pieces
out into their own functions.  Would love for these to be classes but
that'd be a pretty big architectural change right now.

* Change TID to TIN for groups

In order to match the reports we are pushing this out.

* CDR Group Calculation with Provider Sub Scores

Got the group calculations and provider sub calculations correctly working and displaying.

Documented functions and removed unused code.

Added missing escape functions.  Moved the itemized item links to a central location.

* Fix escaping issues and parameter order

Fixed an issue with the group calc having the wrong parameter order.
Also fixed some escaping issues and alphabetize imports.

* Fix limit issues, remove todo

* Added 5.6 QDM models, and a readme how to generate new models

* merge date helper

* Intermediate

* intermediate

* ported a bunch of Ruby code to support Cat III to PHP

* intermediate

* finished porting coding only, haven't run/tested

* Hook up basic rendering of Cat3 XML

* intermediate, walking through template population

* intermediate

* intermedite: added in result calculator

* fix input to export service, now just requires array of measure strings

* added patient addresses and telcoms for qrda cat 1 export

* Updated mustache templates to 3.1.8 qrda-reports

Found we were using a newer version of the mustache templates then what
we will test against for ONC.  I've gone ahead and changed those to the
old version for the Cat 3 reports.  Also found that the templates using
the ruby-ism of ? to denote a boolean question can't be processed in PHP.
So I've switched the templates that use the functionName? to drop the
question mark which allows those functions to actually execute
correctly.

* Updated to latest oe-cqm-module version.

* resolve patient extension

* fix date format for JSON cqm calculation, add result to procedure QDM

* fix typos in query

* fix styling

* trying to fix styles again

* try fixing style again
