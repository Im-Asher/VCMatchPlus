* Fixes #5220 Send Trusted Direct Message

Implemented the ability to send messages w/o attachments via the EMR
Direct service over the Direct protocol.

Built the ability to select a document that has been uploaded to the
system and send it via EMRDirect.

Built a document finder dialog window so that you can select a patient
or non-patient document using the finder.  It checks against the current
user's ACLs and the document category's acos to determine if the user
can see the document.  It only shows 25 results at a time and requires
the user to be more specific in their search if they want to see more.
By default it displays the most recent documents uploaded.

* Direct pdf attachment send.

Made it so we can send a pdf attachment via direct.

Validated the mime types and reject any document that can't be sent via
Direct.  Interestingly direct supports sending HTML but our default
OpenEMR whitelist doesn't allow it.

* Fix styles

* Fix case where document is empty.

Changing up the ACL validation broke the functionality for sending a
single message w/o an attached document.

* Hide alerts before each message send.

If the same message error comes back for each message send it appears
like the direct message never sent.  Hiding the alerts each time when
the send button is pushed is a better UX experience.

* Implemented Document File Preview for messages.

Messages was throwing a javascript error if you didn't assign a patient
for a document.  However, often the document is what contains the
information about what patient the file should belong to.  I made it so
that if there is no assigned patient you can at least view the document
in the Miscellaneous -> New Documents screen.

This also facilitates testing with ONC as we have to demonstrate that
the Direct file was successfully decrypted and viewable.

* Fixes #5220 Send Trusted Direct Message

Implemented the ability to send messages w/o attachments via the EMR
Direct service over the Direct protocol.

Built the ability to select a document that has been uploaded to the
system and send it via EMRDirect.

Built a document finder dialog window so that you can select a patient
or non-patient document using the finder.  It checks against the current
user's ACLs and the document category's acos to determine if the user
can see the document.  It only shows 25 results at a time and requires
the user to be more specific in their search if they want to see more.
By default it displays the most recent documents uploaded.

* Direct pdf attachment send.

Made it so we can send a pdf attachment via direct.

Validated the mime types and reject any document that can't be sent via
Direct.  Interestingly direct supports sending HTML but our default
OpenEMR whitelist doesn't allow it.

* Fix styles

* Fix case where document is empty.

Changing up the ACL validation broke the functionality for sending a
single message w/o an attached document.

* Hide alerts before each message send.

If the same message error comes back for each message send it appears
like the direct message never sent.  Hiding the alerts each time when
the send button is pushed is a better UX experience.

* Implemented Document File Preview for messages.

Messages was throwing a javascript error if you didn't assign a patient
for a document.  However, often the document is what contains the
information about what patient the file should belong to.  I made it so
that if there is no assigned patient you can at least view the document
in the Miscellaneous -> New Documents screen.

This also facilitates testing with ONC as we have to demonstrate that
the Direct file was successfully decrypted and viewable.

* Fix code review issues.",Stored XSS Leads To Session Hijacking in GitHub repository openemr/openemr prior to 6.1.0.1.,0cf4ce14e9fec4908f5da7b7a4470badc7e7d9c0,0

can easily expand / add additional report item types such as the group
calculation method.

* Fix CQM formatting and data display problems.

Fix the old CQM reports for formatting and data display problems.  We
want to make sure we don't break the old reports.

* Fix CDR result links,formatting

* Refactored CDR Twig to be more DRY

* CDR provider,plans result report fixes

* Group Calculation Initial Support

Initial support for group calculation method

* More work on group calculation

* Group Calculation Encounter Relationship

Implemented the group calculation encounter relationship.  The primary
relationship is stubbed out but has some bugs I'll need to work on
fixing.

Also moved the patient report item tracker into a class relationship
that could eventually be used to streamline bulk inserts on the report
items.

Added some basic documentation and broke the group calculation pieces
out into their own functions.  Would love for these to be classes but
that'd be a pretty big architectural change right now.

* Change TID to TIN for groups

In order to match the reports we are pushing this out.

* CDR Group Calculation with Provider Sub Scores

Got the group calculations and provider sub calculations correctly working and displaying.

Documented functions and removed unused code.

Added missing escape functions.  Moved the itemized item links to a central location.

* Fix escaping issues and parameter order

Fixed an issue with the group calc having the wrong parameter order.
Also fixed some escaping issues and alphabetize imports.

* Fix limit issues, remove todo

* merge date helper

* Intermediate

* ported a bunch of Ruby code to support Cat III to PHP

* intermediate

* finished porting coding only, haven't run/tested

* Hook up basic rendering of Cat3 XML

* intermediate, walking through template population

* intermediate

* intermedite: added in result calculator

* fix input to export service, now just requires array of measure strings

* added patient addresses and telcoms for qrda cat 1 export

* Updated mustache templates to 3.1.8 qrda-reports

Found we were using a newer version of the mustache templates then what
we will test against for ONC.  I've gone ahead and changed those to the
old version for the Cat 3 reports.  Also found that the templates using
the ruby-ism of ? to denote a boolean question can't be processed in PHP.
So I've switched the templates that use the functionName? to drop the
question mark which allows those functions to actually execute
correctly.

* Updated to latest oe-cqm-module version.

* resolve patient extension

* fix date format for JSON cqm calculation, add result to procedure QDM

* fix typos in query

* fix styling

* trying to fix styles again

* try fixing style again

cause of this would be an inability to add entries on the rx ring
when we run out of mbufs. cope with this by calling rxeof from the

unconditionally tries to fill the rx ring, even if it doesnt dequeue
any packets off the ring.

while here limit the number of entries that can go on the rx ring

cause of this would be an inability to add entries on the rx ring
when we run out of mbufs. cope with this by calling rxeof from the

unconditionally tries to fill the rx ring, even if it doesnt dequeue
any packets off the ring.

while here limit the number of entries that can go on the rx ring

currently re appears to end up spinning on landisk. the most obvious
cause of this would be an inability to add entries on the rx ring
when we run out of mbufs. cope with this by calling rxeof from the
isr when the FIFO_OVERFLOW status bit is set. rxeof in turn
unconditionally tries to fill the rx ring, even if it doesnt dequeue
any packets off the ring.

while here limit the number of entries that can go on the rx ring

an empty ring (cos the producer and consumer are the same in both

currently re appears to end up spinning on landisk. the most obvious
cause of this would be an inability to add entries on the rx ring
when we run out of mbufs. cope with this by calling rxeof from the
isr when the FIFO_OVERFLOW status bit is set. rxeof in turn
unconditionally tries to fill the rx ring, even if it doesnt dequeue
any packets off the ring.

while here limit the number of entries that can go on the rx ring
to 1 less than the size of the ring. a full ring looks the same as
an empty ring (cos the producer and consumer are the same in both
cases), so avoid letting this happen.

session engine was able to write data to the TCP socket. If the send hold
timer expires bgpd was not able to send any data to that neighbor for at
least 90 seconds and therefor the session is forcefully closed with a hold
timer expired notification.

The send hold timer acts as a last resort to detect faulty peers. On an
idle session it can take a long time until this timer triggers but the
main goal here is to reset a stuck session at some point which did not
happen before.

It would be convenient if there were a channel a thread could sleep on
to indicate they do not want any wakeup(9) broadcasts.  The easiest way
to do this is to add an ""int nowake"" to kern_synch.c and extern it in
sys/systm.h.  You use it like this:

	#include <sys/systm.h>

	tsleep_nsec(&nowait, ...);

There is now no need to handroll a local dead channel, e.g.

	int chan;

	tsleep_nsec(&chan, ...);

which expands the stack.  Local dead channels will be replaced with
&nowake in later patches.

One possible problem with this ""one global channel"" approach is sleep
queue congestion.  If you have lots of threads sleeping on &nowake you
might slow down a wakeup(9) on a different channel that hashes into
the same queue.  Unsure how much of problem this actually is, if at all.

NetBSD and FreeBSD have a ""pause"" interface in the kernel that chooses
a suitable channel automatically.  To keep things simple and avoid
adding a new interface we will start with this global channel.

The 'nominal core crystal clock frequency' from cpuid 0x15 is 0 on
Intel model 0xa5 (CML-H CML-S62 CML-S102) and 0xa6 (CML-U62). So act as
if 24 MHz was reported like we do on other Skylake/Kaby Lake variants.
Comet Lake processors with model 0x8e (CML-U42 CML-Y42) use the same model
number used by Kaby Lake and many other parts which was already handled.

While we could approximate the crystal frequency with 'Processor Base

get ntpd to sync a clock on a Skylake machine with:
CPUID 0x15: eax=2, ebx=134, khz=0
CPUID 0x16: eax=1600, ebx=1600, ecx=100, edx=0
with reported crystal frequency changing from 24000 kHz to 23880 kHz
(cpuid 0x16 eax * 1000 * cpuid 0x15 eax / cpuid 0x15 ebx) and
TSC frequency changing from 1608000000 to 1599960000.

Cannon Lake, Ice Lake, and Tiger Lake are known to return non-zero

bd_rdStart is strange.  It nominally represents the start of a read(2)
on a given bpf(4) descriptor, but there are several problems with it:

1. If there are multiple readers, the bd_rdStart is not set by subsequent
   readers, so their timeout is screwed up.  The read timeout should really
   be tracked on a per-thread basis in bpfread().

2. We set bd_rdStart for poll(2), select(2), and kevent(2), even though
   that makes no sense.  We should not be setting bd_rdStart in bpfpoll()
   or bpfkqfilter().

3. bd_rdStart is buggy.  If ticks is 0 when the read starts then
   bpf_catchpacket() won't wake up the reader.  This is a problem
   inherent to the design of bd_rdStart: it serves as both a boolean
   and a scalar value, even though 0 is a valid value in the scalar
   range.

So let's replace it with a better struct member.  ""bd_nreaders"" is a
count of threads sleeping in bpfread().  It is incremented before a
thread goes to sleep in bpfread() and decremented when a thread wakes
up.  If bd_nreaders is greater than zero when we reach bpf_catchpacket()
and fbuf is non-NULL we wake up all readers.

The read timeout, if any, is now tracked locally by the thread in
bpfread().

Unlike bd_rdStart, bpfpoll() and bpfkqfilter() don't touch
bd_nreaders.

The problem is that this timer only looks at the receive side of the TCP
session. If for some reason the send side stalls the system fully depends
on the remote BGP peer to reset the session. As seen in an ever growing
OutQ and as a result important changes can get stalled and cause routing
troubles.

This change introduces a SEND HOLD timer. The timer is reset whenever the
session engine was able to write data to the TCP socket. If the send hold
timer expires bgpd was not able to send any data to that neighbor for at
least 90 seconds and therefor the session is forcefully closed with a hold
timer expired notification.

The send hold timer acts as a last resort to detect faulty peers. On an
idle session it can take a long time until this timer triggers but the
main goal here is to reset a stuck session at some point which did not
happen before.

0.27964961528778076,0,0.0,2,0,12,2,14,3,"tsleep(9): add global ""nowake"" channel for threads avoiding wakeup(9)

It would be convenient if there were a channel a thread could sleep on
to indicate they do not want any wakeup(9) broadcasts.  The easiest way
to do this is to add an ""int nowake"" to kern_synch.c and extern it in
sys/systm.h.  You use it like this:

	#include <sys/systm.h>

	tsleep_nsec(&nowait, ...);

There is now no need to handroll a local dead channel, e.g.

	int chan;

	tsleep_nsec(&chan, ...);

which expands the stack.  Local dead channels will be replaced with
&nowake in later patches.

One possible problem with this ""one global channel"" approach is sleep
queue congestion.  If you have lots of threads sleeping on &nowake you
might slow down a wakeup(9) on a different channel that hashes into
the same queue.  Unsure how much of problem this actually is, if at all.

NetBSD and FreeBSD have a ""pause"" interface in the kernel that chooses
a suitable channel automatically.  To keep things simple and avoid
adding a new interface we will start with this global channel.

The 'nominal core crystal clock frequency' from cpuid 0x15 is 0 on
Intel model 0xa5 (CML-H CML-S62 CML-S102) and 0xa6 (CML-U62). So act as
if 24 MHz was reported like we do on other Skylake/Kaby Lake variants.
Comet Lake processors with model 0x8e (CML-U42 CML-Y42) use the same model
number used by Kaby Lake and many other parts which was already handled.

While we could approximate the crystal frequency with 'Processor Base
Frequency' from cpuid 0x16 eax like FreeBSD and Linux do, kettenis@ couldn't
get ntpd to sync a clock on a Skylake machine with:
CPUID 0x15: eax=2, ebx=134, khz=0
CPUID 0x16: eax=1600, ebx=1600, ecx=100, edx=0
with reported crystal frequency changing from 24000 kHz to 23880 kHz
(cpuid 0x16 eax * 1000 * cpuid 0x15 eax / cpuid 0x15 ebx) and
TSC frequency changing from 1608000000 to 1599960000.

Cannon Lake, Ice Lake, and Tiger Lake are known to return non-zero

0.259835809469223,0,0.0,2,0,25,35,60,4,"bpf(4): bpf_d struct: replace bd_rdStart member with bd_nreaders member

bd_rdStart is strange.  It nominally represents the start of a read(2)
on a given bpf(4) descriptor, but there are several problems with it:

1. If there are multiple readers, the bd_rdStart is not set by subsequent
   readers, so their timeout is screwed up.  The read timeout should really
   be tracked on a per-thread basis in bpfread().

2. We set bd_rdStart for poll(2), select(2), and kevent(2), even though
   that makes no sense.  We should not be setting bd_rdStart in bpfpoll()
   or bpfkqfilter().

3. bd_rdStart is buggy.  If ticks is 0 when the read starts then
   bpf_catchpacket() won't wake up the reader.  This is a problem
   inherent to the design of bd_rdStart: it serves as both a boolean
   and a scalar value, even though 0 is a valid value in the scalar
   range.

So let's replace it with a better struct member.  ""bd_nreaders"" is a
count of threads sleeping in bpfread().  It is incremented before a
thread goes to sleep in bpfread() and decremented when a thread wakes
up.  If bd_nreaders is greater than zero when we reach bpf_catchpacket()
and fbuf is non-NULL we wake up all readers.

The read timeout, if any, is now tracked locally by the thread in
bpfread().

Unlike bd_rdStart, bpfpoll() and bpfkqfilter() don't touch
bd_nreaders.

i have some qsfp DACs and a couple of optics, and they're all
terrible, so this is about as far as i can go for now. at least the
code will be robust in the face of terrible modules though.

the DACs are pretty dumb and basically report that they're DACs
with some strings. this code just prints that they're DACs with
strings now.

modules are supposed to be able to report overall temperature and
voltage, and optics can report tx and rx values for the 4 different
signal lanes they're supposed to provide. interestingly the current
values are always reported in the lower page, but thresholds are
reported in page 3, but not all modules support page switching.
devices are supposed to say whether they can switch pages, but i
have one that does say it can switch but then doesn't. anyway, the
take away is that it is therefore possible for a module to report
values without also
reporting thresholds.

this sets the code up to report the values on their own if we can't
query page 3 for any reason.

if the temp sensor value looks bogus (ie, 0x0000 or 0xffff), assume
the monitor values are bogus and bail early.

This has benefits for userland programs trying to look at scan results,

Nodes will still be evicted from the cache in one of several ways:

Add a new way of timing out inactive nodes which don't send a beacon
within 10 scan iterations, for client mode only. This should get rid
of stale APs if we're scanning for some time in a changing environment.

If we fail to associate a few times, the corresponding node is removed.

If net80211 transitions back to INIT state (e.g. because of a
user-initiated configuration change) all nodes are removed.

When a background scan starts all nodes will be removed. This could be
revisited later but has been intentionally left as-is for now.

much memory all cluster pools combined together can allocate from
the system. The limit is set to kern.maxclusters number of 2Kb
increments which allows us to display current, peak and maximum
